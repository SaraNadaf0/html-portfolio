<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>

<p>Hey there! </p>
<p>I am Sara Nadaf, and you are welcome to my built-in pure HTML website, am a 21-year-old BCA student,</p>
<p>I wrote my first code at the age of 19, and like any other kid I knew technology was in my blood, </p>
<p>Life isn't the same for everyone, for me nothing seemed good,</p><br>
<p>I wanted to gain knowledge, but I lacked guidance, </p>
<p>I wanted to land tier 1, but I could only afford decent college,</p>
<p>I wanted to enhance my leadership skills, but my mates always bullied me. </p>
<p>My family wasn't supporting me enough, and it felt terrible, </p><br>
<p>Finally, I decided ... nothing's going to work on its own! </p>
<p>Somehow, I desperately wanted to fix things,</p>
<p>I started learning online, Freedcamp, Accenture, amazon, google, Udacity, and free YT, </p>
<p>First, I discovered coding ... I found developing and publishing solutions to problems on the internet was awesome,</p><br>
<p>Secondly, I found my uni payment button wasn't working, just because it wasn't made to perform responsiveness, that's where I discovered UI... </p>
<p>Later I discovered you need a copy to present on the websites. which helps in the conversation rate of a company.</p>
<p>I gave my 3 years into studying everything relevant to these industries, </p>
<p>Human psychology, persuasion writing, material design principles,</p><br>
<p>visual design fundamentals, device accessibility, development enhancement, AI and so on.</p>
<p>not from anywhere or everywhere, but from the best out of the best mentors worldwide.</p>
<p>But during this period, I lost my personal life, I had no friends, I had no elder support,</p>
<p>my clock wasn't moving according to day and night, I ate junk,</p><br>
<p> I had medical issues, and after hitting 20 I had legal issues, </p>
<p>Yes! I have experienced everything... </p>
<p>from being a good decent nerd to facing family drama, financial drama, and legal conversations, </p>
<p>while holding my career tight under my palms...</p>
<p>but let's not talk about the odds.</p><br>
<p>"I was blessed with odds to find my even" - Sara Nadaf</p><br>
<p>After everything, I believe the mother universe is forgiving, and gives you another chance to become what you wished for...</p>
<p>right now I am re-starting my journey, emptying my brain, calming my soul, and learning again.</p><br>
<p>maybe I don't know what a great programmer does, what platforms they use, </p>
<p>and what interviews they prepare for, but I will learn. </p>
<p>I was alone when I started. </p>
<p>I will be alone when I achieve it, </p>
<p>and there is no shame in restarting your journey,</p><br>
<p>PS: 98% of women feel hopeless every year just because society blames their character again and again... </p>
<p>and never gave them that chance to rebuild their lives...</p>
