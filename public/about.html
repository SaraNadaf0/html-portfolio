<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hey there! Am Sara Nadaf , am 21 year old (but i did nothing like 21 year old), Bca undregrad stud (from a boring uni), and you are welcome to my built in pure Html website,
    btw i wrote my first code at the age 19 and my day dreaming of becoming rich one day was begin, i knew technology was in my blood, but i did'nt knew where to start from,
</p>
 
 <p>Lifey isn't the same for everyone, for me nothing was easy, i wanted to gain knowledge but i lacked guidence, i wanted to land tier 1 but i can only afford tier 4, i wanted to enhance my leadership skills but jelous classmates never gave me that chance. My family was'nt supporting, and it feelt terrible, 
    Finally i decided ... nothings going to work! i have to try outside the box </p>
 
 <p>I started learning from online, Freecodecamp, accenture, amazon, google, udacity, YT, First i dicovered coding ... which is a must if you want to build and launch a subject on the internet, Secondly i found my uni payment button wasn't working just because it was not responsive that's where i discovered UI... Later i discovered you need copy to present on the websites.. which helps in conversation rate of a company.
 </p>
 
 <p>I gave my 3 years into studying everthing relavent to these industries, Human pyschology, persuasion writing, material design principles, visual design fandamentals, device accessablity, developement enhnacement,
    marketing acqusition model, not from anywhere or everywhere, but from the best out of best mentors world wide. </p>
 
 <p>But during this period i lost my personal life, i had no friends, i had no elder support, my clock wasn't moving according to day and night, i ate junk, i had medical issues, after hitting 20 i had legal issues,
    Yes! i have exprienced everything... from being a good decent nerd to facing family drama, financial drama, legal conversations, while holding my career thight in my palms... but let's not talk about the odds.
 </p>
 
 <p>"I was blessed with odds to find my even" - Sara Nadaf</p>

 <p>After everything, i believe mother universe is forgiving, and gives you another chance to become what you wished for... right now i am re- starting my journey, emptying my brain, calming my soul, and learning again.. <br>
may be i don't know what a great programmer does, what platforms they use, what interviews they prepare for, but i will learn .. i was alone when i started .. i will be alone when i achieve it,
and there is no shame behind re starting your journey,</p>

<p>PS: There are 98% women who feel hopeless every year just because the society blamed there charcater again and again... and never
    gave them that chance to re built their life...
